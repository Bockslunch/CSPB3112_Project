What did you do last week?
Finishing up the Python Essential Training sections on Threading and Processes, Working with Files, and Packaging Python.Â 

What do you plan to do this week?
Continue on with Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals. I've never done any Data Science before so this will all be new and hopefully exciting.

Are there any impediments in your way?
I have a test in a different class that will take a bit extra time for studying, but I should at least get to start the Data Science course.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Most of the time, I end up putting all of the work done on this into one day, but I'd like to split it up over a few days instead. It would not only lessen the brain workload, but also show how much I remember from previous days and let me know what I need to review.
