What did you do last week?

Dug into the first few sections of Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals. I learned about the gap in supply and demand for Data Scientists, mainly due to practically EVERY industry needing them. Also learned what sorts of skills and programming languages will be important (python, pandas, SQL, TensorFlow, Linear Algebra, Probability, Regression, and Substantive/Topical expertise) I have a decade of biomedical research experience, so I'm hoping to focus on bioinformatics. I also learned about 6 phases in the CRISP-DM model. Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining and some of the primary roles in data science like Engineers, Machine Learning experts, Analysts, Managers, etc.


What do you plan to do this week?

Continue on with Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals. Now that I've had a nice introduction into the topics, I'm looking forward to getting more into the real meat of the course.


Are there any impediments in your way?

Barring myself or a member of the family coming down with sickness or some other emergency, I don't foresee any problems.Â 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I thought that breaking the coursework up over a few days would work better, but due to other classes taking much of my time, I still ended up doing most of this work on one day. It's not the worst way of doing things, but I'd like to at least TRY splitting it up and seeing if I like that better or worse than focusing just on one day. We will see if the workload from other classes allows this plan to workout.
