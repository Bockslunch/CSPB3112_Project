What did you do last week?
Went through the first 4 sections of Python Essentials. Most of it was a refresher on syntax and technical terms I had learned years ago, so it definitely helped to bring all of that back to the forefront of my mind, since I haven't used Python in a while. I also got to learn some new aspects of Python that I hadn't learned before, namely "comprehensions", which seem to be SUPER handy and common, so that'll definitely help in the long run.

What do you plan to do this week?
Continue on with the Python Essentials training on LinkedIn Learning. I like the format and teacher. It's a nice mix of fast enough but slow enough, if that makes any sense at all, and the teacher is showing all the code on her screen as she's doing it, so that really helps me immediately see the code in action and how it all works. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
I have a couple tests coming up in my other classes next week, so those will probably get most of my attention, but I'll still be able to do some training on this as well.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
I think the process worked just fine this last week, but I know the upcoming sections have a bit more coding for me to do, so I'll be doing that stuff in Jupyter Notebook for practice with Python.
