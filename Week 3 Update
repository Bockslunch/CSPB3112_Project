What did you do last week?
Looked into some LinkedIn Learning options for gaining skills in software development: Python, SQL, Agile/Waterfall, SDLC, etc. I'm going to find 1-3 that I like and focus on those. I know YouTube is FULL of good training videos for all of these options and more, so I'll definitely be digging around on there as well.Â 

What do you plan to do this week?
Dive into one or more of the aforementioned programs on LinkedIn Learning.

Are there any impediments in your way?
General understanding and coding skills (for now), which I'm hoping to mitigate by learning more of the basics and gaining strength/confidence.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
So after digging further into my original plan (and even from the beginning) I'm starting to feel like my original idea is WAY over my head/abilities at this time. I think I'm going to revert back to some sort of LinkedIn course to build skills toward my original goal. I'm still in year 1, so without a solid base of skills and understanding, I know I would struggle and become quite frustrated trying to do something FAR above my comprehension (at this time). I'll definitely be returning to the original topic, but maybe in some later class project or even in another round of this course, but later in my comp sci "career".
