What did you do last week?
Went through the next 4 sections of Python Essentials. Some was review, like the Control Flow and Functions sections, and even some of the Classes section, but even in reviewing common concepts, I still learned more about Python syntax and some tricks to make your code cleaner and more Pythonic. I also got to learn about handling Errors and creating Custom Exceptions, which seems pretty important, so I'll definitely be circling back to that for review.

What do you plan to do this week?
Continue on with the Python Essentials training on LinkedIn Learning. I'll definitely be doing more coding moving forward since pretty much everything from here on out is seems new to me. The hands on practice will be important to solidifying the knowledge and skills learned. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
Not that I know of. I've been sick this week, so that was my main impediment, but I was still able to push through and get some training done. Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, I should be able to keep on schedule and get through at least a couple more sections.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
While I was able to take good notes on new concepts, I definitely want to start following along with the lessons by typing up similar code and doing some of the "challenges" in Jupyter notebook. That will give me the practical knowledge/skills necessary to succeed.
