What did you do last week?

Continued on with the Data Science Foundations course on LinkedIn. This chapter is about AI/ML, deep learning neural networks (probably one of the most intriguing topics in this industry), big data, predictive and prescriptive analytics, and business intelligence. 


What do you plan to do this week?

Continue on with Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals. Upcoming chapter is more about Ethics and Agency to include Bias, Security, Legal, Explainable AI, and Agency of algorithms and decision makers. Sounds interesting, and I can imagine it will be pretty informative, considering I know practically nothing about these topics. Novelty for the win!


Are there any impediments in your way?

I'm struggling to truly understand the workings of GitHub and might have to detour away from the Data Science course and start learning more about the ins and outs of how to properly use GitHub and its myriad options. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?


I'm still finding that just focus firing on this class 1 day out of the week is about the only way I can get it to work well with my school schedule and family life. I guess I'm just resigned to doing that. Seems to work well so far, though, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
